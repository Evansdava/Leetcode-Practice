        Move all 0s to the end of the array without modifying the relative order of other elements
        - Can the arary have anything other than integers?
        - Is the array sorted?
        - Do the items have to be moved, or can new ones be inserted?

        Relatively na√Øve solution
        * Pop each 0 and append a 0 for each
        
        Not operation/time efficient (extra O(n-i) operations for each 0 found, where n is the number of elements and i is the index of the iteration), but doesn't take extra space
        
        More efficient:
        * Move each element other than 0 backwards, pushing 0s to the end
        
        Less space efficient (created new list), but max of 5 operations per element added, runs in O(n)
        
        For each element in the array
            if the element is not 0
                swap it with the first 0 in the array 
            otherwise, if it is 0
                Keep track of the index
